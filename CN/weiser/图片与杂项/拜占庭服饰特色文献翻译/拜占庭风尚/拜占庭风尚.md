# 介绍
拜占庭帝国诞生于公元330年，当年君士坦丁一世将罗马帝国迁都，新的都城之名便是君士坦丁堡，或者有个更为人所知的名字——拜占庭（如今被叫唤伊斯坦布尔）。君士坦丁一世特别中意于该城可以同时掌控地中海、爱琴海与黑海的战略地位。活跃在这条从斯堪的纳维亚和俄罗斯延伸至亚美尼亚乃至埃塞尔比亚的贸易线路上的商旅为拜占庭帝国带来了巨量的财富。公元364年，瓦伦提尼安一世为了便于对帝国疆域的管理，便将罗马帝国分为了两份，分别是东西罗马。然而东西罗马却大为不同，东罗马相对来说人口更多，也更加富有。在公元五世纪的西罗马帝国覆灭于日耳曼哥特人之手后，东部的拜占庭帝国肚子延续了1100余年之久。直至1453年，君士坦丁十一世的死以及君士坦丁堡陷落于奥斯曼土耳其人，为这个千年帝国拉上了帷幕。
```
The Byzantine Empire began in A.D. 330, when Emperor Constantine I moved the capital of the Roman Empire to a cirty that became known as Constantinople, or Byzantium(modern-day Istanbul).Constantine I was impressed by the city's strategic location, notably its command of the mediterranean, Aegean, and Black seas. The Byzantine Empire's thriving commercial trade led to immense wealth, its trade routes extending from Scandinavia and Russia to Armenia and Ethiopia. In A.D. 364, Emperor Valentinian I divided the Roman Empire into two parts——east and west——with two emperors, to faciliate the management of the vast territory. East and west, however, differed greatly, the eastern portion having a larger population and greater wealth. After the fall of Rome in the fifth century at the hands of Germanic Goths, the eastern Byzantine Empire ruled alone. This empire lasted for over 1100 years—— until 1453, the year of the death of Emperor Constantine XI and the fall of the empire to the Ottoman Turks.
```

在这一时期，拜占庭的服装获得了比罗马最为辉煌时期还要丰富的颜色、布料和装饰。拜占庭的文化也同样是对东西方兼收并蓄。拜占庭的时尚不仅仅是那些拜占庭之城市中的市民所身着之服装，也同样是那些受其影响地区譬如意大利、希腊、俄罗斯所穿着的服饰。在公元六世纪之前，罗马风格的影响仍然很强，服饰剪裁仍然以披挂样式为主。长袍（tunica）（一种普遍穿着的、用未染色羊毛或亚麻制成的宽松披挂衣物）、达尔马提卡（dalmatic）（一种宽袖的外袍，普通人用棉、亚麻或羊毛制成，富人则用丝绸）、以及斯多拉（stola）（一种由折叠矩形布料制成、高腰束带的女性服装），构成了拜占庭风格的基本基础。达尔马提卡从帝国早期（六至十世纪）开始时的及膝长度款式，逐步发展至十至十三世纪时的及地长度，最终在十四十五世纪演变的类似于土耳其长袍（caftan)。而从一开始，拜占庭的布料以及颜色都深受波斯、亚述、埃及和阿拉伯风格的强烈影响。
```
During this era, costume attained a richness of color, fabric ,and ornment that far exceeded the greatest days of Rome. The Byzantine culture was a complex blending of east and west. Inculeded within Byzantine fashions are not only those styles worn in the city of Byzantium after it became the capital of the Romam Empire, but also  clothing worn in regions that fell under its influence, such as Italy, Greece , and Russia. Until the sixth century, the Roman influence was still strong, with draped styles predeminating th e cut of dress. The tunica(a universally worn loosely draped garment of undyed wool or linen), the dalmatic (a wide-sleeved over-robe of cotton, linen or wool for the commoners, and silk for the wealthy), and the stola(a high-belted woman's garment constructed from a folded rectangle) were the basic foundations of Byzantine style. The dalmatica evolved from knee-length in the early part of the empire (sixth to tenth centuries) to floor-length (tenth to thirteenth centuries), finally resembling a Turkish  caftan in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries. From the beginning, the fabrics and colors used were strongly influenced by Persian, Assyrian, Egyptian, and Arabian sources.
```

我们对于拜占庭风尚的知识大多来源于雕塑以及马赛克画。那些服饰制品为我们表现了由繁复、精美的织锦和宝石所装饰的织物。这些精锻面料为衣物平添了硬挺与光泽，这与罗马时期依赖柔软羊毛、亚麻的披挂风格形成了不同。查士丁尼皇帝在六世纪时将产丝技术引进君士坦丁堡。丝绸面临催生出更鲜艳颜色如宝石红、黄、蓝、绿、金的使用，但法律规定身着紫色的权力仅仅属于皇帝和皇后。饰带（tablion，有时也被称为clavus）是拜占庭宫廷中独有的物件，这是一种镶嵌在男女披风之上用珠宝装点的长方形织物，用以表明穿戴者之身份显贵。另一间不同寻常的服饰则是来自于波斯的马尼亚基斯（maniakis），这是一种独立佩戴的衣领，由金线刺绣并镶嵌宝石的布料制成。
```
Most of our knowledge of Byzantine fashions comes from surviving mosaics and sculptures. Clothing artifacts reveal remarkably intricate, elaborate brocaded fabrics with jeweled surfaces. These brocaded fabrics gave a new stiffness and luminosity to garments——a departure from the soft wool and inen that characterized Roman drapery. The Emperor  Justinian introduced the manufacture of silk to Constaninople in the sixth century. Silk fabric allowed for the use of brilliant colors——jewel-lik reds, blues, yelows, greens and gold (the privilege of wearing purple was limited to emperors and empresses by law). A uniquely Byzantine article worn at court was  the the tablion(sometimes called a clavus), an ornamental jewel-encrusted, rectangular piece of fabric inset on men's and women's cloaks. The tablion ideentified the wearer as a member of the royal house or court dignitary. Another unusual garment was the Persian-derived maniakis, a separate collar of gold-embroidered, jewel-encrusted fabric.
```

拜占庭连身裙通常会将手臂和腿覆盖，袖口一直延伸至腕部。八世纪之后，洛鲁姆（lorum）被引入拜占庭，这是一个围绕身体披挂的长围巾，让人联想到被他所取代的罗马长袍（托加）。洛鲁姆通常是由丝绸和金片组成，并装饰着繁重的珠宝，用以向世人揭示穿戴者的地位。绅士们会将左前缘披在身前。而妇女们在托尼卡（tunica）外穿一件斯托拉（stola、pulla），并用衣物的一端作为头巾覆盖住头部。无论男女都用一个名字叫“fibula”的华丽宝石扣针将斗篷固定在右肩上。
> Loros，lorum latin
```
Byzantine dress typically covered the arms and legs, sleeves extending to the wrists. After the eigth century, the lorum was introduced, a long scarf that was draped around the body, reminiscent of the Roman toga that it had replaced. The lorum was generally made of silk or gold cloth and was heavily jeweled, indicating the wearer's status. Men of means draped the left front edge. Women wore a stola(palla) over their long tunicas, using one end of the garment as a head covering. Both men and women fastened their mantles on the right shoulder with an ornate jeweled clasp called a fibula. The camisia, an undergarment made of linen or silk, was worn beneath the tunica, protecting the rich farbrics of the outer garments from body oils and perpiration. The long tunica evolved into gunna(gown). In the latter centries of Byzantine rule, a short shirt with long dolman-style sleeves, called a juppe, was worn over long tunicas.
```

拜占庭帝国为西方时尚做出了两个重要的贡献。在第三世纪的时候，她的纺织工人开始使用梭子来织造带有图案的织物，后来，在六世纪，查士丁尼皇帝推动了养蚕业的兴荣。在他的支持下，蚕卵和桑种被两位波斯僧侣藏于中空的竹子之中带入了拜占庭。直到帝国陨落前，拜占庭的服饰风格因此变得越来越华丽。拜占庭服饰的影响贯穿了中世纪和文艺复兴时期的风尚，还未东西方基督教会礼拜服饰奠定了基础，其中对于俄罗斯教会的影响尤其显著。
```
The Byzantine empire made two important contributions to western fashion. In the third century, its weavers began using shuttles to produce patterned fabrics. Later, in the sixth century, Emperor Justinian initiated the raising of silkworms from the cocoon. Under his aegis, silkworm eggs and seeds of the mulberry bush, concealed in hollow bamboo staffs, were brought into Byzantium by two Persian monks. The Byzantine mode of dressing became more and more sumptuous until the fall of the empire; its influence is evident throughout the Medieval and Renaissance periods of European fashion. In addition, it provided the foundation for the liturgical costume of both the eastern and western Christian churches, particularly those of Russia.

奥托三世，一位德国战士国王（统治时间：996–1002），征服了拜占庭并成为皇帝。他的品味比其前任更简约，拜占庭的服饰在一段时间内变得类似于日耳曼中世纪的服装。这里，奥托宫廷中的一位男士和一位女士穿着简单且几乎没有装饰的长袍。男子的披风颜色较暗；它的浅色tunica装饰珠宝和金边刺绣，而女子穿着一件暗色长袍，佩有金色的带饰，肩上披着一条浅色的披肩（palla），并把他缠绕在腰部。

Otto III, a German warrior-king (ruled 996–1002), conquered Byzantium and became emperor. His tastes were less ornate than those of his predecessors, and for a while Byzantine costumes resembled Germanic medieval garb. Here, a man and woman of rank from Otto’s court wear robes of simple, barely embellished design. The man’s cloak is dark; his pale tunica has jeweled, gold-embroidered trim. The woman wears a dark robe with gold banding and a light-colored palla draped over the shoulder and wrapped about the waist.

到了十四世纪，女性的tunica已经发展成了古娜（gunna），即长袍，而披肩（palla）则变成了围绕臀部佩戴的腰带。然而，面料仍然华丽，且上面装饰有精美的刺绣和珍珠、宝石的点缀。男性的服饰也简化为长袍，通常在前面有丰富的刺绣装饰，背部则悬挂着一条长裙，并且常常被从前方的手臂上托起。这里展示的长袍有达尔马提式（dalmatic）的袖子，穿在一件内衬衫上。男女的长袍都是用深色丝绸制成，并且点缀着明亮的金色和多彩的刺绣。
```
By the fourteenth century, the woman’s tunica had evolved into a gunna, or gown, and the palla had taken the form of a sash worn around the hips. However, the fabrics remained opulent, and were elaborately embroidered and studded with pearls and jewels. Male attire had also been simplified to a gown, often enhanced by a richly embroidered front panel and a train hanging from the back and carried across the arm in front. The gown shown here has dalmatic sleeves and is worn over a shirt. Both the man’s and the woman’s gowns are made of dark silks enhanced with bright gold and multicolored embroidery.
